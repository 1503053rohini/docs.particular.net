title: Upgrade from V4 to V5
summary: Instructions on how to upgrade from NServiceBus versions 4 to 5 
tags:
---

## Move to .net 4.5

In V5 the new minimum .net version for NServiceBus will 4.5. 

**This means consumers need to update all projects (that reference NServiceBus) to be .net 4.5 before updating to NServiceBus V5. **

In the interest of "smaller changes are easier to verify" it is recommended that you do the update to .net 4.5, and full migration to production, before updating to NServiceBus V5.

## Interfaces assembly and nuget deprecated

The NServiceBus interfaces dll was created to allow people to have a smaller dependency when creating a messages assembly. With the introduction of unobtrusive messages that is no longer required. As such `NServiceBus.dll` will be merged into NServiceBus.Core.dll. Also the `NServiceBus.Interfaces` nuget will be deprecated.

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2113

### If using nuget packages

No extra work should be required. A normal nuget update should result in no `NServiceBus.Interfaces` nuget being used and a V5 version of the `NServiceBus` nuget being used. This is achieved through some [nuget sleight of hand](
https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2113). 

If for some reason this sleight of hand fails then manually remove usages of the `NServiceBus.Interfaces` nuget and ensure the V5 version of the `NServiceBus` nuget is used. 

### If using manual references

 * Remove all references to `NServiceBus.dll`
 * Update all references of `NServiceBus.Core.dll` to V5

### Reflection

Remember of you have any reflection that makes assumptions on the assembly name of `NServiceBus.dll` you will need to update that code and re-test

### Binding Redirects

Any binding redirects pointing to `NServiceBus.dll` should be removed.

## Configure API

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/356

## Logging

Doco PR here https://github.com/Particular/docs.particular.net/pull/336

## Obsolete sending and publishing batches of messages together in a single call

As part of V5 batch sending of messages has been removed.

So previous code that looks like this

```
bus.Send(new Message1(), new Message2(), new Message3());
```
Should be changed to this

```
bus.Send(new Message1());
bus.Send(new Message2());
bus.Send(new Message3());
```

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/1346


## InMemory removal

Due to significant confusion about the usage of this API it has been removed from V5. People using this API should either 

 * move over to doing a normal `Send` or 
 * call the the required methods explicitly  

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2084

## Remove IMessageModule in favor of IManageUnitsOfWork

As part of V4 an improved abstraction (`IManageUnitsOfWork`) was introduced and `IMessageModule` was deprecated. 

In V5 this changed is being completed with the remove of `IMessageModule`.

Uses of `IMessageModule` should be replaced with    `IManageUnitsOfWork`.

## Pull Gateway out of the core

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/1603

## Pull Raven out of the core



https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/1605

## Pull the distributor out of the core

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/1604

## Obsoleted the IWantToRunBeforeConfiguration api since its no longer needed 

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/pull/2180

## Obsoleting the IFinalizeConfiguration interface in favor of features

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/pull/2178

## Remove UnicastBus.Start(Action)

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2168

## Remove ForInstallationOn<T>, Windows and IEnvironment

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2167

## Make Scheduler API instance based

So this code 

<!-- import SchedulerV4 -->

Would now look like this 

<!-- import SchedulerV5 -->

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/pull/2192

## Make ConfigureHowToFindSaga abstract

Old saga mapping
```
public class MySaga : Saga<MySagaData>,
                    IAmStartedByMessages<Message1>,
                    IHandleMessages<Message2>
{
    public override void ConfigureHowToFindSaga()
    {
        ConfigureMapping<Message2>(m => m.SomeID)
            .ToSaga(s => s.SomeID);
    }

... Handle methods
}
```

New Saga mapping
```
public class MySaga : Saga<MySagaData>,
                    IAmStartedByMessages<Message1>,
                    IHandleMessages<Message2>
{

    protected override void ConfigureHowToFindSaga(SagaPropertyMapper<MySagaData> mapper)
    {
        mapper.ConfigureMapping<Message2>(s => s.SomeID)
            .ToSaga(m => m.SomeID);
    }

... Handle methods
}
```

## IConfigureThisEndpoint.Init now returns a Configure instance


## Standardise extension methods to configure persistences

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2102

## Obsolete SerializationSettings WrapSingleMessages and DontWrapSingleMessages 

In version 5 multi-message sends is being removed. So Wrapping messages is no longer required. Uages of these methods should be removed.

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2104

## Change IMessageSerializer.Serialize to take a single message

In version 5 multi-message sends is being removed. So serialization of an array of messages is no longer required.

Implementations of `IMessageSerializer` should change to take a single object. 

Usages of `IMessageSerializer` should no longer pass in an array of objects. 

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2105

## Replace ISaga with non generic base class "Saga"

Use abstract classes `Saga<T>` or `Saga` instead.

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2095

## Remove Bus.Subscribe Predicate overloads

Instead create a Handler that does this filtering logic and then, optionally, calls `DoNotContinueDispatchingCurrentMessageToHandlers`. This 
Handler should be ordered to run before other handlers.

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/2088

## Remove this.Bus() for IHandleMessages implementations

In V4 there was an extension method on `IHandleMessages` that supplied a static instance of the `IBus`. This allowed consumers to write `this.Bus().Reply(response);`.

While this was convenient the tax of allowing static access to an instance of the `IBus` was too high. As such this extension has been removed. 

The replacement is to inject an instance of `IBus` as a constructor parameter and then assign that to a field for later use.

## Remove .RunCustomAction()

## List of all other obsoletes

TODO: this will be a reflection generated list of all obsoletes currently in the core.
