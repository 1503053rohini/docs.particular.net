## Supported Versions

Product Previews will always be released as a major version 0. Once a product releases version 1 or greater, it is no longer part of the Preview program and does not follow this support policy.

WARN: Only the latest minor version of the Preview will be supported.

## Compatibility guarantees

Previews may break backwards compatibility at any time, this applies to, but is not limited by:

- API changes
- Features supported
- Wire compatibility (if applicable)
- Data storage compatibility (if applicable)

## Previews are public for a limited time

Preview products are public for a limited time, after which they are either promoted to the Particular Platform with a 1.0 release and afterwards supported under the standard support policies, or they are retired and no further maintenance or support will be provided.
