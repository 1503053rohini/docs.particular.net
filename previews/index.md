Previews allow Particular Software to develop new features more quickly while better addressing user needs. User feedback is central to this, so the more feedback is received, the better the end result. 

Previews also allow for determining whether these new features are a good match for users. The more a Preview is used in production, the higher the chance that Preview will be incorporated into the platform indefinitely.
