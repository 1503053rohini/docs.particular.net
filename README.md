## Disclaimer

This is a spike at storing documentation inside a git repository.

Since it is a spike no promises are made about if this will still exists in the future. 

## How to contribute

Before you start ensure you have

 *  Created a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
 *  Signed the Particular [Contributor License Agreement](http://www.particular.net/contributors-license-agreement-consent).

There are two approaches to contributing

### The GitHub web UI 

For simple changes the GitHub web UI should suffice.

 * Find the page you want to edit on http://particulardocs.cloudapp.net/
 * Click the `Improve this doc` this will take you to the GitHub copy of the markdown for this page.
 * Click `Edit`. This will automatically fork the project so you can edit the file.
 * Make the changes you require. Ensure you verify your changes in the `Preview` tab
 * Add a description of your changes
 * Click `Propose File Changes`

### By forking and submitting a pull request

For more complex changes you should fork and then submit a pull request. This is useful if you are proposing multiple file changes

 * [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) on GitHub
 * Clone your fork locally
 * Work on your feature
 * Push the up to GitHub
 * Send a Pull Request on GitHub

For more information see [Collaborating on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles) especially [using GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) 

## Markdown

The pages are currently rendered using [MarkdownDeep](http://www.toptensoftware.com/markdowndeep/) with *Markdown Extra Enhancements* enabled. 

There are some slight difference between MarkdownDeep and the GitHub flavoured Markdown. So when changes are accepted you should double check how the rendered version looks.

For editing markdown on you desktop using MarkdownDeep try the following

### [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/)

Ensure you enable *MarkdownDeep Extras* by going to 

    Tools > Options > Markdown > Markdown Processor > Markdown (Extra)  

### [MarkPad](http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/) 

Ensure you enable *MarkdownDeep Extra* by going to 

    Settings > markdown extra > toggle the switch to red

More info on Markdown see [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
