## Header management

### Setting headers on outgoing messages

Headers are now set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options. `Bus.SetMessageHeader` is no longer available.

Full documentation on how to manage headers can be found [here](/nservicebus/messaging/message-headers.md) 


### Setting outgoing headers for the entire endpoint

NServiceBus allows you to set headers that are applied to all outgoing messages for the entire endpoint. In version 6 you now do this using:

<!-- import header-static-endpoint -->


### Setting headers on the outgoing pipeline

Headers can now be set using `context.SetHeader` like show below

<!-- import header-outgoing-behavior -->

Also note that headers are "set" only on the outgoing pipeline.

## Using a custom correlation id

Custom [correlation Id's](/nservicebus/messaging/message-correlation.md) for outgoing messages should now be set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options instead of being passed into `bus.Send`



## Message mutators

The `IMessageMutator` and `IMutateTransportMessages` interfaces are no longer available. Instead you should just use the individual `IMutateOutgoingMessages`, `IMutateIncomingMessages`, `IMutateIncomingTransportMessages` and `IMutateOutgoingTransportMessages` as needed since they provide the same functionality.

### New context arguments

The signature for the mutators now pass context arguments that gives you access to relevant information on the message and also giving you ways to mutate the message. This context will give you access to the same functionality as previous versions so just update your code accordingly.

See [header mangement](/nservicebus/messaging/message-headers.md) for one example on how this might look.
