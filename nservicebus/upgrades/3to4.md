## Selecting transport to use

`configure.MsmqTransport()` has been obsoleted, please use `configure.UseTransport<Msmq>()` instead.


## Enabling Sagas

The API for enabling sagas has changed.

<!-- import 3to4EnableSagas --> 


## Persistence

The configuration API to select persistence has been changed in Version 4. Please see below for details.


### RavenDB Version

NServiceBus V4.0 requires newer version of RavenDB. See [RavenDB Version Compatibility](/nservicebus/ravendb/version-compatibility.md) for more details. 


### Timeouts

`configure.RunTimeoutManagerWithInMemoryPersistence()` has been obsoleted and you should now enable InMemory storage for timeouts using `configure.UseInMemoryTimeoutPersister()`. More info on InMemory persistence [here](/nservicebus/persistence/in-memory.md).


## Default transaction isolation level

The default transaction [IsolationLevel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.transactions.isolationleve.aspx) is now `ReadCommitted`. To revert to `Serializable`:

<!-- import 3to4RevertToSerializable -->


## INeedToInstallInfrastructure is deprecated 

Use `INeedToInstallSomething` instead. See [NServiceBus Installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) for more information.


## SecondLevelRetries

The type `SecondLevelRetries` has been moved from the `NServiceBus.Management.Retries` namespace to the `NServiceBus.Features` namespace. See [Automatic Retries](/nservicebus/errors/automatic-retries.md) for more information.


### Disabling 

The api for disabling SecondLevelRetries has changed.

<!-- import 3to4DisableSecondLevelRetries -->


## TransactionalTransport

The type `NServiceBus.Unicast.Transport.Transsactional.TransactionalTransport` has been renamed to `NServiceBus.Unicast.Transport.TransportReceiver`.


## INeedInitialization moved

The interface `INeedInitialization` has been moved from `NServiceBus.Config.INeedInitialization` to `NServiceBus.INeedInitialization`. If you get a `ambiguous reference` error you may need to fully qualify your usage of that interface. See [Life-cycle initialization](/nservicebus/lifecycle/ineedinitialization.md) for more information.


## INeedToInstallSomething

The `INeedToInstallSomething` interface is now resolved via the container. See [NServiceBus Installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) for more information.


## License detection changes

The locations that NServiceBus will scan for a valid license has been expanded. See [How to install your NServiceBus license file](/nservicebus/licensing/license-management.md) for more information.


## MsmqTransportConfig deprecated

The `MsmqTransportConfig` section has been deprecated in favor of `TransportConfig`.
 
<!-- import 3to4TransportConfig -->

## Powershell cmdlet Updates 

NServiceBus PowerShell cmdlets have moved to NServiceBus.PowerShell.dll. See [Management using PowerShell](/nservicebus/operations/management-using-powershell.md) for more information.


## Serialization

`configure.JsonSerializer()` has been obsoleted, please use `Configure.Serialization.Json();` instead. More info on supported serializers [here](/nservicebus/serialization/).


## Logging

The NServiceBus NuGet package no longer depends on `log4net` and this means that if you where using `log4net` in Version 3 that dependency may be removed when you do a NuGet package upgrade. To solve this just install the latest `log4net` Version 1.2 package into your project. You can find more details on integrating with `log4net` [here](/nservicebus/logging/log4net.md).
