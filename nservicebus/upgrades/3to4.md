## Selecting transport to use

`configure.MsmqTransport()` has been obsoleted, please use `configure.UseTransport<Msmq>()` instead.

## Persistence
The configuration API to select persistence has been changed in Version 4. Please see below for details.


### Timeouts

`configure.RunTimeoutManagerWithInMemoryPersistence()` has been obsoleted and you should now enable InMemory storage for timeouts using `configure.UseInMemoryTimeoutPersister()`. More info on InMemory persistence [here](/nservicebus/persistence/in-memory.md).


## Serialization

`configure.JsonSerializer()` has been obsoleted, please use `Configure.Serialization.Json();` instead. More info on supported serializers [here](/nservicebus/serialization/).


## Logging

The NServiceBus NuGet package no longer depends on `log4net` and this means that if you where using `log4net` in Version 3 that dependency may be removed when you do a NuGet package upgrade. To solve this just install the latest `log4net` Version 1.2 package into your project. You can find more details on integrating with `log4net` [here](/nservicebus/logging/log4net.md).
