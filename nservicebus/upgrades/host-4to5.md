## Roles are obsolete

In Versions 5 and above roles are obsoleted and should not be used. The functionality of `AsA_Server`, and `AsA_Publisher` have been made the defaults in core and can be safely removed. Read the [Host guidance on alternatives for using roles](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/?version=host_5#roles-built-in-configurations).
