Define a maximum value for the number of messages per second that the endpoint will process at any given time. This will help avoiding the endpoint from overloading sensitive resources that it's using like web-services, databases, other endpoints etc. A concrete example could be an integration endpoint calling a web API, like api.github.com, that have restrictions on the number or requests per unit of time allowed.

NServiceBus will not enforce any throughput restrictions by default.
