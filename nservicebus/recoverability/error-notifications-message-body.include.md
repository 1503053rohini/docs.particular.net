Since the message could have failed due to a de-serialization exception it is not possible for the API to provide the instance of the message. For the same reason is it recommended that consumers of this API do not attempt to deserialize the message instance. If the message contents is required for debugging purposes it is recommended to convert it to a string using the .net encoding APIs.
