The license can be stored in a registry key called `[HKEYCURRENTUSER\Software\NServiceBus\{Major.Minor}\License]`.

To install the license in the registry, use one of these options:

 * The `LicenseInstaller.exe` tool that comes with the NServiceBus install.
 * The [Install-License](/nservicebus/operations/management-using-powershell.md) PowerShell commandlet.
 * If the trial license has expired and running in debug mode, the endpoint shows a dialog that allows installing the license.
