NServiceBus can be configured to use [Spring](http://www.springframework.net/) for dependency injection.


### Default Usage

snippet: Spring


### Existing Instance

snippet: Spring_Existing


### DependencyLifecycle Mapping

The way that the NServiceBus.Spring adapter is implemented means that the [dependency lifecycle](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/#dependency-lifecycle)'s of NServiceBus do not map directly to Spring Object Scopes. Almost all of the lifecycles have been implemented using a custom type regsitrations on top of a [Generic Application Context](http://springframework.net/docs/1.1-RC1/sdk/1.1/html/Spring.Core~Spring.Context.Support.GenericApplicationContext.html).
