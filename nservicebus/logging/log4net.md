Support for routing log entries to [Log4Net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/) is compatible with NServiceBus 3 and higher.


### NServiceBus Version 3 and 4 

In Version 3 and 4 of NServiceBus Log4Net support was built in.


### NServiceBus Version 5 and higher 

In NServiceBus Version 5 Log4Net was externalized to its own [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Log4Net/) package available that allows for simple integration of NServiceBus.


## Usage 

<!-- import Log4netInCode -->


## Filtering 

If NServiceBus writes a significant amount of information to the log. To limit this information you can use the filtering features of your underlying logging framework. 

For example to limit log output to a specific namespace.

Here is a code configuration example for adding a [Filter](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/manual/configuration.html#filters).


### The Filter

<!-- import Log4netFilter -->
