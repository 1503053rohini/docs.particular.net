title: Capture and visualize metrics using Prometheus and Grafana
component: Metrics
---

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is a monitoring solution for storing time series data like metrics. [Grafana](https://grafana.com) allows you to query and visualize the data stored in Prometheus (and other sources). This sample demonstrates how to capture NServiceBus metrics, storing these in Prometheus and visualizing this using Grafana.

This sample reports the following metrics to Prometheus:

 * Fetched messages per second 
 * Failed messages per second
 * Successful messages per second

 The sample also shows data like `Average message processing time in milliseconds` and `Maximum critical time in milliseconds`. For a detailed explanation of these metrics refer to the [metrics captured section in the metrics documentation](/nservicebus/operations/metrics.md#metrics-captured).


## Prerequisites

To run this sample, download and run both Prometheus and Grafana. This sample uses Prometheus 1.7.1 and Grafana 4.4.2 that both run on Windows.

- https://grafana.com




## Code overview

The sample simulates messages load with a random 10% failure rate using the `LoadSimulator` class:

snippet: load-simulator


## Use NServiceBus.Metrics to capture metric values

To capture the metric values generated by NServiceBus, a class called `PrometheusFeature` is added to the sample. It is responsible for enabling the NServiceBus metrics feature.

snippet: enable-nsb-metrics



snippet: register-probe



## Configure Prometheus

Prometheus needs to be configured to pull data from the endpoint. Edit `prometheus.yml` and  add a new target for scraping similar

```
- job_name:       'nservicebus'

    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3030']
        labels:
          group: 'production'

```
