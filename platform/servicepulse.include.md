ServicePulse is a web application designed for administrators. It provides a clear, near real-time, high-level overview of how a system is currently functioning.

Notifications are shown when an endpoint is offline or when a message fails. [Custom checks](/monitoring/custom-checks/) can be used to provide notifications for more specific scenarios. The ServicePulse UI provides common operations for failure recovery, such as retrying failed messages.

NOTE: Further custom behaviours for message failures and other events can be acheived using [ServiceControl events](/servicecontrol/contracts.md).
