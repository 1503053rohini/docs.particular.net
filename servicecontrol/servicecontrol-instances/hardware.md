Ensure that:

 * enough RAM is used, 6GB minimum;
 * data is stored on disks suitable for low latency write operations (fiber, solid state drives, raid 10)
 * multiple CPU cores are available
 * infrastructure is monitored (CPU, RAM, disks, network)
 * data is not stored on the same physical system drive
 * the storage drive is reserved for ServiceControl
