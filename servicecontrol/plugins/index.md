ServiceControl is the backend service for ServiceInsight, ServicePulse, and third-party integrations. It collects and stores information from monitored NServiceBus endpoints and exposes this information for consumption by various clients via a HTTP API.

NOTE: When ServiceControl is introduced into an existing environment the standard behavior of error and audit queues will change. When ServiceControl is not monitoring the environment failed messages will remain in the configured error queue and audit messages in the configured audit queue, as soon as ServiceControl is installed and configured messages, in both queues, will be imported by ServiceControl.

Plugins collect information from NServiceBus and are deployed together with each NServiceBus endpoint.
These plugins are optional from the perspective of the NServiceBus framework itself (they are not required by the endpoint), but they are required in order to collect the information that enables ServiceControl (and its clients) to provide the relevant functionality for each plugin.


## Installing and Deploying

The ServiceControl plugins are deployed with the endpoints they are monitoring. You can add a plugin to an endpoint during development, testing, or production:

* During development, add the relevant plugin NuGet package to the endpoint's project in Visual Studio using the NuGet.
* When in production, add the plugin DLLs to the BIN directory of the endpoint, and restart the endpoint process for the changes to take effect and the plugin to be loaded.

NOTE: For NServiceBus version-dependent requirements for each plugin, review the "Dependencies" section in the NuGet Gallery page for the specific plugin.

## Connecting to ServiceControl

Once deployed on an active endpoint, the endpoint sends plugin-specific information to ServiceControl. Plugins send messages using the defined endpoint transport to the ServiceControl queue. Location of ServiceControl queue is determined by the following:

1. **Endpoint`s configuration file**  
Check for an `appSetting` named `ServiceControl/Queue` e.g. `<add key="ServiceControl/Queue" value="particular.servicecontrol@machine"/>`.
1. **Convention based on the configured Error Queue machine**  
If an error queue is configured, for example `error@MachineName`, then the queue `Particular.ServiceControl@MachineName` will be used.
1. **Convention based on the configured Audit Queue machine**  
If an audit queue is configured, for example `audit@MachineName`, then the queue `Particular.ServiceControl@MachineName` will be used.

WARNING: Endpoint with plugins installed that cannot communicate to ServiceControl will shut down.

The ServiceControl queue (and all other ServiceControl related sub-queues) are created during the installation phase of ServiceControl.  

NOTE: If you're using MSMQ and have configured ServiceControl to import audit and error queues those queues must be present on the same machine as ServiceControl is installed on.
